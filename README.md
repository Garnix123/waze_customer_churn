The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a binomial logistic regression model on a real-world example. For this particular type of regression I've chosen to analyze Waze's customer churn.

The goal is to build a binomial logistic regression model and evaluate the model's performance.

Waze, a popular community-driven GPS navigation app owned by Google, leverages real-time user data to help drivers avoid traffic, hazards, and delays. Like many digital services, Waze faces the challenge of customer churn — the phenomenon where users stop using the app over time. Understanding and predicting churn is critical for Waze to maintain its active user base, increase engagement, and sustain growth. By analyzing user behavior, trip frequency, engagement patterns, and external factors, data scientists can identify at-risk users and develop targeted strategies — such as personalized notifications, new feature recommendations, or rewards — to reduce churn and enhance user loyalty.
